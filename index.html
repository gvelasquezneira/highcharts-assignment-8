	<h2>Retail Theft in Gainesville    </h2>

	<p>Retail theft and the threat of violence accounted for about $112 billion in losses, according to a 2023 report by the National Retail Federation. 
    </p>

       <p>However, crime data shows that crime has fallen in Gainesville since 2018.

        According to the same data, retail theft crime in Gainesville centers around Butler Plaza and University Avenue. 
        
        Still, Hayes said the retail theft is often under-reported. 
         </p>   <p>“The police data are very inaccurate…You're only measuring, who knows what percent of crime, 10, 40 percent, maybe 50? It depends,” Hayes said. “Obviously, as you probably know, the more violent, the more likely are reports.” 
        </p>
        <p>WUFT confirmed that there are disparities in police reporting by combining Alachua County complaints. Not all cases are properly attributed by police as retail thefts. Instead, they are marked as grand theft, petit theft or building theft.

        <h2>Organization Retail Crime and Prevention (ORCAP)</h2>


        <p>Through a group called Organization Retail Crime and Prevention (ORCAP),
     which comprises loss prevention officers from retail stores and police, store employees can send photos
      to other stores and police through a group chat-like system to help identify thieves.</p>

        <p>“If you have a really good photo, you can run a comparison against driver's license, mug shots, Florida DOC
     (Department of Corrections), and then other systems will hit it off of, like, everybody talks about, Clearview,” Ferrara said. </p>
        <p> Law enforcement then pays for the technology to help with investigations. However, humans make the final decision. </p>
